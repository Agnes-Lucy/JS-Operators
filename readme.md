1. Below are the symbols for the below JavaScripts operators
i. Arithmetic Operator : "+" addition , "-" substraction , "/" diviion, "*" multiplication, "**" exponentiation, "%" modulo, "++" increment, "--" decrement.

ii. Assignment Operator: "=", "=+", "-=", "/=", "*=", "%="

iii. Comparison Operator: "==" loose equality , "===" strict equality, "!=" not equal to, ">" greater than, "<" less than, ">=" greater than or equal to,"<=" less than or equal to.

iv. logical Operator: "&&" and, "||" or, "!". 

v. Bitwise Operator: "|" or, "&" and,  "^" XOR, "~" NOT, "<<" zero fill left shift, ">>" signed right shift, >>> Zero fill right shift


2. Below are examples for the following JavaScript Operators:
i. Arithmetic Operators: 
addition operator:
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
console.log (x+y) // 7

increment operator:
console.log (++x) // 6

ii. Assignment Operator 
a = 5;
c-=5 // c = c - 5;
d*=5 // d = d * 5; 

iii. Comparison Operator:
let x = 5;
console.log ( x === "5") // false
console.log ( x < = 5) // True

iv. Logical operator:
&& ( and operator)
let age = 60;
let continent = "Africa";
(age <= 30 && continent === "Africa") ? console.log ("Qualified to run") : console.log ("Not Qualified to run") // return Not qualified to run

|| (or operator)
let Biology = "pass";
let AgriculturalScience = "fail";
( Biology=== "Pass" || AgriculturalScience==="Pass") ? console.log ("Admitted") : console.log ("Admitted") // return pass

Bitwise  operator:
AND (&): when a bitwise "&" is performed on a paiir of bits it returs 1 if both bits are 1.
e.g: 1111 & 0100//  0100

OR (|) : when a bitwise OR is performed on a pair of bits, it returns 1 if one of the bits is 1
e.g: 1111|0010 // 1111
